<div class="QA">
<p> <i> Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)&#63; </i> </p>
<p> I consider myself more of a designer than a developer. It can be argued that the ways things are going it won’t be long before the two are one and the same. But if I have to choose I would choose designer because I place more emphasize and time on aesthetics than functionality. Also I more interested in art then coding. </p>

<div class="QA">
<p> <i> What are you most interested in learning in this class&#63; </i> </p>
<P> I am most interested in learning how to make a website attractive. The sad truth is even if a website has perfect coding it still can’t compete with a website with decent coding that looks stunning. First impressions are everything when it comes to a website so learning how to organize text into boxes and learning how to apply color properly are important. </P>

<div class="QA">
<p> <i>  What is good design&#63; </i> </p>
<p> Good design should serve a purpose, I feel that if something has a purpose. It’s easier for people to relate to it. Good design should be unique because people get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. Lastly good design should be something that is simple because the more complex something is the harder it is to actually create it. </p>

<div class="QA">
<p> <i> What is good web design&#63; </i> </p>
<p> Good web design in my opinion is something that is organized (trying to read a website with jumbled up text is like trying to play golf on the moon), something that is attractive (if you website repels users you’re doing something very wrong) and something that entertains (if a website is entertaining it will attract more users). </p>
</div>

<div class="QA">
<p> <i> What are some examples of good web design&#63; </i> </p>
 <ul> 
<li> <a href="http://www.ch3mical.com/">Ch3mical</a> <p> I chose this website because it has a creative design. When you first enter the website you get a bar that expands when you mouse over it. This is a great twist on the traditional navigation bar which is plain and boring. The layout is neat and organized and the color and the text works well with each other. </p> </li>

<li> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a> <p> This is my second choice because the layout on this page is very organized and neat. Despite having a ton of information the website is still easy to navigate. The main page has the top stories from each section which saves a lot of time. The navigation bar changes cover when you hover it which helps distinguish the buttons from each other. </p> </li>

<li> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a> <p>This is my last choice, I chose this website because it has a great way of saving space. Instead of having a giant wall of text with pictures- the pictures and the text are combined. When you hover over the thumbnail pictures you get the title and a short description. Also the picture are arranged in a tile pattern which makes it very easy to navigate, the color coded tabs of the navigation bar also help. </p> </li>
</ul>

<div class="QA">
<p> <i> What are some great conference&#47;event websites&#63;</i> </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://events.campustechnology.com/Events/CT-Summer-Educational-Technology-Conference/Home.aspx">Campus 2014 Technology</a> <p> I chose this website because I thought the homepage was well made. The first thing you see are the date, time and location in big letters at the top of the page,to me this is good hierarchy. Next you have a slideshow slider that goes through the events which I think is a great way to get information across while keeping the website entertaining. Finally you have all the social media stuff on the bottom so people won’t have to look all over the place. </p> </li>

<li> <a href="http://reptileexpo.com/nyfirst.htm">Reptile Expo NY</a> <p>I chose this website because it has a simple design but it still gets the point across. The different colors helps separate the information which makes it easier to read. Important information are in bright red so it can’t be missed. The green background matches the whole theme (reptiles). And finally the time and date are the biggest letters on the page so you get all of the important stuff at a glance which is a huge time saver.</p> </li>
