    <h3>Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)?</h3>
    <p>I'm really not to great with web developing or designing. I'm a graphic designer and a photographer so i would definatley go more for designing the web than actually developing.</p>
    <h4>What are you most interested in learning in this class?</h4>
    <p>I'm really interested in this class to better my knowledge of web design and web developing for i am not too good at all. I've had professors in the past that have just skipped alot and did'nt show and teach me much. I hope this class will be different. </p>
    <h5>What is good design?</h5>
    <p>Good design is when there is a balance in what the viewer sees. There's not too much of a certain thing and not too less. Everything has great placement in good design. </p>
    <h6>What is good web design?</h6>
    <p>Good web design is when their is a balance as well. The viewer gets to see different parts of the website without killing him/herself. Everything is clean, sharp, spaced out in coloumns and rows and has great color scheme to not look too crazy. </p>
    <h7>What are the good examples of conference/event web sites? Answer by listing at least two sites including each URL and why you chose the site.</h7>
    <p>Good examples of events and conferences sites are <a href="http://rockinrio.com/en"</a></a> and also <a href="http://www.sho.com/sho/sports/home"</a></a></p>
    <p>Each of them is easy to navigate and is well organzied being sharp, really friendly towards the viewers for its simplicity in using both sites. </p>
