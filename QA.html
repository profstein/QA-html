<h3>* Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer 
(or something else, other answers are acceptable)?</h3> 
I consider myself a designer and the main reason is because I usually like the idea of looking at the art and being able to create unique visual things for the eye. <br> Not taking way any credit from progamming, they both help each other because you need good progamming to showcase the designs.</p>

<h3>* What are you most interested in learning in this class?</h3> 
I find it interesting being able to do a mobile website which is one of things I wanted to learn but anything that will make my designing and programming get <br> better will be great. The first task in the first day of class for the BMCC mobile homepage was cool to do as a start up.

<div id="question4" />
<h3>* What is good web design?</h3> 
Modern but easy and simple to use without complications. It doesn't have every color or every text size/font. If is organize and and uses a combination of a <br> few colors that won't hurt the eye from knowing what to click on.

<p>I like the color combination they both have while the layout has a simple nav for the main things and organize with tiles to make them seperate from everything else. <br>Scrolling down makes it easier to it because they don't really move to a secondary page it always has the home page on the header so you can navigate you way back.</p>
