I think these two websites are the good example of conference/event.<br>
1:I like this conference/event website.<br>First of all, the catch copy of the top page made me interest including the design work.
Secondly,it is really clear the purpose of this conference as well as dates and location. Lastly, to show the schedule is clear with each person's description.<br>
