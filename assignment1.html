<p>I like the website.First of all, the catch copy of the top page made me interest including the design work.
Secondly,it is really clear the purpose of this conference as well as dates and location. Lastly, to show the schedule is clear with each person's description.<br>

<p>The other website is this one because it is simple, clear, and understandable on the first page.
